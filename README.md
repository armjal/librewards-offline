# Librewards - Rewarding students for time spent at the library

## A refactoring project
This project initially started out during my studies at university (2020). The aim was to incentivise studying and spending time at the library by rewarding students with points given a certain amount of time spent at the library. This repository and the code within sees to:
- Refactor the code that was developed during university
- Become familiar with Java once again
- Become familiar with Android development

## Commits
Throughout the history, conventional commits were used as an aim to provide further context to changes and understand quicker what constitutes as: refactor, feature, and improvement, or a task.

This is an "offline" version due to interacting with data stored locally and without any requests made to live services. Since this project was initially created, I have developed on top of this an "online" version which interacts with Firebase services for authentication and file and data storage.
