## A refactoring project
This project initially started out during my studies at university. The aim was to incentivise studying and spending time at the library by rewarding students with points given a certain amount of time spent at the library. This repository and the code within sees to:
- Refactor the code that was developed during university
- Become familiar with Java once again
- Become familiar with Android development

## Noteable amendments
- Refactor
    - Modularisation
    - OOP
- Instrumented/Unit testing
- CI Workflow for running tests on PR/push to main

## Technologies
- Java (Application code)
- SQLite (DB)
- XML (UI)

## Commits
Throughout the history, conventional commits were used as an aim to provide further context to changes and understand quicker what constitutes as: refactor, feature, and improvement, or a task.
